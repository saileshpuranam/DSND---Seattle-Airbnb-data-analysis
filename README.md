### Project Motivation and Objective

In this project, I am going to analyze Seattle Airbnb data and answer some questions about Airbnb prices , availability, highly sought after locations etc., in Seattle. This analysis is done using the CRISP-DM process which stands for Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining. Steps included in this process are - business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deployment. Below are the three key questions I tried to answer through this analysis-
1. What are the most prominent features that help predicting Airbnb listing prices? 
2. What is the distribution of Airbnb prices in Seattle?
3. What are the most expensive areas to rent in Seattle?


### Datasets Used

In this project, I have analyzed 3 datasets for Seattle Airbnb. I have sourced these open datasets from Kaggle. The datasets used are - 

1. Listings data - Which has detailed information on various Airbnb listings in Seattle
2. Calendar data - Which has listing availability and price info
3. Reviews data - Which has user reviews for Airbnb listings
